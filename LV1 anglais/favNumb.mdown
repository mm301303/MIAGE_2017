# My favourite number

Without any doubt, my favourite number is 113 divided by 355. It is simple, it takes around 4 bytes to be stored, it is composed only by fibonacci's numbers. 
That is what I call an elegant number. The fact is it represents something so complicated that explaining why fibonaccis numbers are linked to that 113 divided by 355 requires a lot more reflexion than just understanding what what it represents means.
This numer is everywhere in nature, it is a foundation of the most perfected works of human being as some artists and mathematicians thought it was a work of god as a rule to create the world.
This number is found in the most perfect geometric form you could find : a circle of raduis 1.
113 divided by 355 is the best approximation of PI regarding the size of the terms and the precision : accurate to 6 decimal places.
